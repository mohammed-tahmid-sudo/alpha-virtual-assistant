        "*   The data was correctly formatted into a prompt structure (`### Input: ...\\n### Output: ...<|endoftext|>`) and converted into a Hugging Face Dataset with a \"text\" column.\n",
        "*   The model was configured for PEFT training using LoRA with specified parameters ($\\text{r}=64$, $\\text{lora\\_alpha}=128$), and the SFTTrainer was successfully set up with defined training arguments (e.g., batch size 2, 3 epochs, learning rate $\\text{2e}^{-4}$).\n",

        "*   The finetuned model was prepared for inference, and the inference process was demonstrated by generating responses for example prompts.\n",
